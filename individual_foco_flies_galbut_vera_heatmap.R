#Script for creating Figure 2

#The goal of this script is:

#This script makes heatmaps of individual flies from 2017 and 2018 colonies (FoCo-17 and FoCo-18)
#this script focuses on galbut virus (all segs separated), chaq virus, vera virus (all segs separated) and chaq-like (vera) virus

#import the data

df <- read_excel("individual_foco_flies_galbut_vera.xlsx", sheet = "tidy_separate")
#This file has the sample names, corresponding year, the normalized reads (mapping reads per million unique reads), and the virus
#Sample name: [Sex][sample#]-[colony_year] e.g. F10-18 is female fly 10 from the FoCo-18 colony
#Sample name becomes somewhat irrelevant because these sample names are removed from y axis during plot
#Sheet "tidy_separate" has each RNA separated
#Sheet "tidy_condensed" has RNAs mapping read count (besides chaq/chaq-like) combined
#for Figure 2, RNAs were separated -> sheet "tidy_separate"


#add a 1 to any reads that are zero. Need it for log transformation in heatmap

#Turn the 'sample' column into a character vector
df$sample <- as.character(df$sample)
#Then turn it back into a factor with the levels in the correct order
df$sample <- factor(df$sample, levels=unique(df$sample))

#Use the following if using sheet tidy_condensed
# #order the virus seqs instead of alphabetical

#                                         "chaq_vera"))

#use the following if using sheet tidy_separate
#order the virus seqs instead of alphabetical
#this keeps RNAs with their respective virus, and keeps chaq RNAs at the end rather than beginning
