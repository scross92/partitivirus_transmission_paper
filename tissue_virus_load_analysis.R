#Script for analysis for Figure 5C
# Virus load analysis of testes and ovaries compared to bodies

#Aims of this script:

# 1) Plot the virus loads (as determined by virus RNA relative to RpL-32)
# 2) perform a statistical analysis to see if sex tissues have higher virus load
# as compared to the whole body
